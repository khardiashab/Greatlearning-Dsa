## Exercise 1: String Concatenation

Create a program that takes two strings as input from the user and concatenates them together. Then, print the resulting concatenated string. Make sure to handle user input and display the output clearly.

Exercise 2: String Length

Write a program that takes a string as input and calculates its length (the number of characters). Display the length of the string as output.

Exercise 3: Substring Extraction

Build a program that extracts a substring from a given string. Prompt the user to enter a string and then specify the start and end positions to extract a portion of the string. Print the extracted substring.

Exercise 4: String Search

Create a program that searches for a specific word or character in a given string. Prompt the user to enter a string and the word/character they want to search for. Display whether the word/character was found or not, and if found, indicate its position in the string.

Exercise 5: String Manipulation

Write a program that performs various string manipulation tasks, such as:

Convert the string to uppercase.
Convert the string to lowercase.
Replace all occurrences of a specified character with another character.
Count the number of occurrences of a specific substring in the string.
Remove all whitespace characters from the string.
Allow the user to choose which manipulation task they want to perform and display the modified string.

These exercises cover essential operations and concepts related to strings in Java. As you work through them, you'll gain a better understanding of how to work with strings and become more comfortable with string manipulation in Java.;
